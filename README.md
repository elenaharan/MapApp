The MapApp is using geolocation API, third party library Leaflet and the local storage API for storing and retrieving data.
Users will be presented with a map local to where they live, and when they click on any location on the map, a form will be rendered where the users can add their workout stats for either running or cycling types of workout. 
After they press submit, a map marker will be added to the map and the workout details will be displayed in the workout list.
If users click on any of their workouts in the list, the map slides to the location of the workout.
